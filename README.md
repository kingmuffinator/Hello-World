# Hello-World

Jumping on the social media trend "learn to code"

all joking aside,
I am a personal trainer and I would like to build my own website to help people move more while working at a deskjob.

Maybe one day I'll work for a bigger company doing web design but for now I learning through udemy and building my own website.
